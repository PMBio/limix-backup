## Philosophy 

Genomic analyses require flexible models that can be adapted to the needs of the user. 
LIMIX is smart about how particular models are fit to safe computational cost. 


## Installation:

* Recommended is an installation via pypi.
* pip install limix will work on most systems.

* If you want to install LIMIX from source you require:
Python:
- scons, scipy, numpy

* Swig:
- swig 2.0 or higher

***********************************************
NEW RELEASE 1
***********************************************
- merge (Danilo & Paolo)

- GP-mean Association (Danilo)

- remove setParams notify

- clean up covariances
    - notify in clear cache
    - remove notify outside of clear_cache
    - define a covar_base group (clear_all -> clear_cache('covar_base'))
    - define a Z group (to handle change of seeds in the covariance)
    - check that the group default is not used any longer

- fix mean ste when no covariates are considered

***********************************************
NEW RELEASE 2
***********************************************

- Improve mtSet: 2KronSum, 2KronSumLR, 3KronSumLR
    - finalize the math write-up
    - set predictions up for Cov2KronSum, Cov2KronSumLR, Cov3KronSum


- we need more combinators (and more struture):
    - parent class combinator
    - child classes:
        - sum
        - kron
        - 2kronSum, 2kronSumLR, 3kronSumLR

- Variance Decomposition module 

- PRINT method for all classes (Danilo)

- MeanKronSum:
    - clean it up
    - check caching
        (pheno_has_changed and designs_have_changed for mean base)
    - implement Bste

- group-based caching system for general gp

- Logging system (Danilo)

- Phenotype outside of mean
    (think more...)

****************************************************
OTHER TODOs
****************************************************
- website with forum

- check the math for general GP base
    - pseudo inverse of X -> Xp*y 
        (sounds like a very good idea)

- we need more combinators (and more struture):
    - child classes:
        - prod
        - 3kronSum

- need methods for new gp inference: 
    - solve_ls method in covariance
    - need Kx or K_dot method (linear operator)
    - sample_trace method???

- MeanKronSum:
    - change covariates such that F and A are not list but long matrices
        (all rotations on F and A are much faster and no need for for-loop)

- Improve mtSet: 2KronSum, 2KronSumLR, 3KronSumLR
    - speed up using tensorization of gradient operations 
    - generalization of 3KronSumLR to have a fixed effect
    - remove splitter_bed (use splitter instead) and debug it

- fix notation with PEP8 or whatever...

Make this consistent throughout:
    - all things that might change either are set in init or method check=True/False
    - __init__(lots of stuff):
        self._assert dimenstion()
        set stuff (with check=False)
    - you can set all the stuff you want

GPs:
    - gp with 1 kron
    - GP2KronSumLR inherits from GPKron (the same manner GP3KronSumLR inherits from GP2KronSum)
    - GP multi kron sum with missing value handling
        (should handle lowrank-ness and so on so forth)


Cov2KronSum:
    - I wrote this not that I do not fully understand anymore:
        we do not need all those methods (e.g., LcGradCgLc, LcGradCnLc) but can squeeze stuff in Ctilde (see GP2KronSumLR)

Cov2KronSumLR:
    - generalize lowrank-rank1 to any covariance-type
        (should be updated in Cov2KronSumLR::Estar)
    - for now supports only 1 Kroneckered fixed effect term
        (with a generalization to multiple terms the FF term breaks apart)
    - also Cg -> Cr in 2kronSumLR

Covariances:
    - introduce Gower rescaling method

NAMING INCONSISTENCIES
    - W makes the dimensionality in all cases
        W is also the design matrix of fixed effects though!
    - for consistency in gp2kronSumLR: row_cov -> G
    - 3kronSumLR and 2kronSumLR are not consistent
        - in the first (W.T * y) does the dimensionality reduction
        - in the second (W * y) does the dimensionality reduction
    - cov2KronSumLR: make notation consistent with other gps R -> GG (also in gp2KronSumLR)

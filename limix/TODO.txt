--------- PAOLO ------------

mtSet methods (gp2KronSum, gp3KronSum):
    - copy mtSet function over and adapt
    - time check

test diff
    - gps:
        change x and monitor was has been recomputed
        x \in group_cache
        {col_covars, row_covars, pheno, fixed effects}

MeanKronSum:
    - clean it up
    - check caching

MAke this consistent throughout:
    - all things that might change either are set in init or method check=True/False
    - __init__(lots of stuff):
        self._assert dimenstion()
        set stuff (with check=False)
    - you can set all the stuff you want

-------------------------------------- DISCUSSION WITH DANILO --------------------------------

WE NEED MORE TESTS:
    - remove debug methods and move to tests
        (cov2kronSum, cov3kronSum, cov3KronSumLR, ...)

PRINT method for all classes

--------------------------------------- NON URGENT TODOs --------------------------------


Fix notation with PEP8 or whatever...

EXCEPTIONS:
    - we need dimension mismatch

GPs:
    - new caching system for general gp
    - gp with 1 kron
    - GP2KronSumLR inherits from GPKron (the same manner GP3KronSumLR inherits from GP2KronSum)
    - GP multi kron sum with missing value handling
        (should handle lowrank-ness and so on so forth)

MeanKronSum:
    - implement Bste
    - change covariates such that F and A are not list but long matrices
        (all rotations on F and A are much faster and no need for for-loop)

Cov2KeonSum:
    - I wrote this not that I do not fully understand anymore:
        we do not need all those methods (e.g., LcGradCgLc, LcGradCnLc) but can squeeze stuff in Ctilde (see GP2KronSumLR)

Cov2KronSumLR:
    - generalize lowrank-rank1 to any covariance-type
        (should be updated in Cov2KronSumLR::Estar)
    - for now supports only 1 Kroneckered fixed effect term
        (with a generalization to multiple terms the FF term breaks apart)
    - also Cg -> Cr in 2kronSumLR

Covariances:
    - introduce Gower rescaling method

NAMING INCONSISTENCIES
    - W makes the dimensionality in all cases
        W is also the design matrix of fixed effects though!
    - for consistency in gp2kronSumLR: row_cov -> G
    - 3kronSumLR and 2kronSumLR are not consistent
        - in the first (W.T * y) does the dimensionality reduction
        - in the second (W * y) does the dimensionality reduction
    - cov2KronSumLR: make notation consistent with other gps R -> GG (also in gp2KronSumLR)

Predictions:
    - set predictions up for Cov2KronSum, Cov2KronSumLR, Cov3KronSum

General questions:
    - Phenotype outsid of mean?
    - define a rotated mean class??
    - undertand how Areml is informed
        this is not clear to me at all

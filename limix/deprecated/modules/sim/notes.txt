1. set_fixed_effects
    actually this sets the eff size of the fixed effect

    My proposal:
    set_fixed_effect_design(X)
    set fixed_effect_effsize(b)
    set fixed_effect(design=X, effsize=b)

    An other thought:
    How about having add_fixed_effect instead of set_fixed_effect???

    e.g. in the multi-trait case one has mean = \sum_i FBA
            F = sample design
            A = trait desig
            B = effect sizes

2. add_random_effect

    I think we want to have the number of causal not the fraction 

3. the pheno simulator demo should not depend on the geno generator 

------------------------------


Xf = # samples x # foreground snps
add_fixed_effect(design=Xf, effesize=bf, var=0.2)

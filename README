# LIMIX

## What is LIMIX?

LIMIX is a flexible and efficient linear mixed model library with interfaces to Python. 
Limix is currently mainly developed by 

Franceso Paolo Casale (casale@ebi.ac.uk)
Danilo Horta (horta@ebi.ac.uk) 
Christoph Lippert (chrisoph.a.lippert@gmail.com) 
Oliver Stegle (stegle@ebi.ac.uk) 


## Philosophy 

Genomic analyses require flexible models that can be adapted to the needs of the user. 
LIMIX is smart about how particular models are fit to safe computational cost. 


## Installation:

* Recommended is an installation via pypi.
* pip install limix will work on most systems.
* LIMIX is particular easy to install using the anaconda python distribution: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda.

* If you want to install LIMIX from source you require:
Python:
- scipy, numpy, pandas, cython

* Swig:
- swig 2.0 or higher (only required if you need to recompile C++ interfaces)

## How to use LIMIX?
A good starting point is our package Vignettes. These tutorials can are available in this repository: https://github.com/PMBio/limix-tutorials.

The main package vignette can also be viewed using the ipython notebook viewer:

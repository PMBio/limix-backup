By Christoph Lippert (lippert@microsoft.com),
Franceso Paolo Casale (casale@ebi.ac.uk), and Oliver Stegle (stegle@ebi.ac.uk) 


## Philosophy 

Genomic analyses require flexible models that can be adapted to the needs of the user. 
LIMIX is smart about how particular models are fit to safe computational cost. 


## Installation:

* Recommended is an installation via pypi.
* pip install limix will work on most systems.

* If you want to install LIMIX from source you require:
Python:
- scons, scipy, numpy

* Swig:
- swig 2.0 or higher

## How to use LIMIX?
A good starting point is our package Vignettes. These tutorials can are available in this repository: https://github.com/PMBio/limix-tutorials.

The main package vignette can also be viewed using the ipython notebook viewer:

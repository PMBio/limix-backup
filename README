Code conventions:

Some care needs to be taken, in particular to allow for semingless integration with SWIG.

1) getters and setters
Key for ease of use are the SWIG components that allow for conversion of MatrixXd/VectorXd components to python arrays.
The relevants bits are in src/python_interface/eigen.i
Note: all classses have MatrixXd getX() components and agetX(MatrixXd* out)
The former are very useful for C++ internal usage. In Swig agetX is used and getX is ignored (see for example covaraince.h)

Note: aXXX denotes "argout" version of the getter/accessor.

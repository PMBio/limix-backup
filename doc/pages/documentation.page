  \section intro_sec Introduction
  LIMIX is a computationally efficient and flexible toolkit for covariance modelling and mixed model problems.
  In brief, LIMIX provides support for GWAS, variance component analysis, multi trait modelling and estimation of large covarainces.

  LIMIX is fully implemented in C++ and provides interfaces to python. We plan to add interfaces to R in the future.
